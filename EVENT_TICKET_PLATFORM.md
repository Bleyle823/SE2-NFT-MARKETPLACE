# Event Ticket Platform - NFT-based Event Management System

## Overview

This project has been transformed from a simple NFT example into a comprehensive NFT-based event ticket platform. Users can create events, mint tickets as NFTs, and manage their event tickets through a modern web interface.

- **Create Events**: Event organizers can create events with details like name, description, location, date, ticket price, and maximum tickets
- **Event Status Control**: Organizers can activate/deactivate events
- **Revenue Tracking**: Real-time tracking of ticket sales and revenue

### üéüÔ∏è NFT Ticket System
- **Unique Tickets**: Each ticket is a unique NFT with rich metadata
- **IPFS Storage**: Ticket metadata is stored on IPFS for decentralization
- **Custom Attributes**: Support for seat numbers, venue sections, and custom traits
- **Event Details**: Each ticket contains comprehensive event information

## Smart Contract Architecture

### EventTicket Contract
The main contract (`EventTicket.sol`) extends OpenZeppelin's ERC721 standard with:

- **Event Management**: Create and manage events
- **Ticket Minting**: Mint tickets as NFTs with payment
- **Access Control**: Organizer-only functions for event management
- **Revenue Distribution**: Automatic payment to event organizers

### Key Functions
- `createEvent()`: Create a new event
- `mintTicket()`: Purchase and mint a ticket
- `setEventStatus()`: Activate/deactivate events
- `getEvent()`: Retrieve event information

## Frontend Architecture

### Pages
1. **Home** (`/`): Platform overview and navigation
2. **Events** (`/events`): Browse and purchase event tickets
3. **My Tickets** (`/myNFTs`): View and manage your NFT tickets
4. **Create Event** (`/ipfsUpload`): Event creation and ticket metadata generation
5. **Organizer Dashboard** (`/organizer`): Manage your events and track sales

### Components
- **EventCard**: Display event information and purchase options
- **TicketCard**: Show ticket details with event information
- **EventForm**: Create new events with validation
- **MetadataGenerator**: Generate rich ticket metadata

## Metadata Structure

Each ticket NFT contains:
```json
{
  "name": "Event Name - Ticket #123",
  "description": "Official ticket for Event Name",
  "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/...",
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Event Date",
      "value": "2024-01-15T19:00:00Z",
      "display_type": "date"
    },
    {
      "trait_type": "Seat Number",
      "value": "A12"
    }
  ],
  "event_details": {
    "event_id": 1,
    "event_name": "Concert",
    "event_date": "2024-01-15T19:00:00Z",
    "location": "Madison Square Garden",
